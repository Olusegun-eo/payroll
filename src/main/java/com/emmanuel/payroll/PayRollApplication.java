/*
In this implementation, we have the necessary entity classes (Employee, CadreLevel, Position, PayrollComponent) mapped with appropriate annotations. We also have a PayrollSetupService for setting up cadre levels, positions, and payroll components.

The PayrollService provides methods to retrieve employee earnings and deductions based on the employee's cadre level. The PayrollController exposes endpoints to fetch employee earnings and deductions.

Please note that this is a basic implementation, and you may need to further enhance it based on your specific requirements.
 */


/*
To test the implemented endpoints using Postman, follow these steps:

Start the application and make sure it is running successfully.
Open Postman and create a new request by clicking on the "New" button.
Set the request type to "GET" and enter the URL for the desired endpoint. For example:
To retrieve employee earnings: http://localhost:8080/payroll/employees/{employeeId}/earnings
To retrieve employee deductions: http://localhost:8080/payroll/employees/{employeeId}/deductions
Replace {employeeId} with the actual ID of the employee you want to retrieve data for.
Add any required request headers or parameters if applicable.
Click the "Send" button to send the request to the server.
Postman will display the response received from the server, showing the employee earnings or deductions.
Make sure you have the appropriate data in your database, including employees, cadre levels, positions, and payroll components, before testing these endpoints. You can use the provided PayrollSetupService to set up the required data or manually add them to your database.

Note: Ensure that the application is running on the specified port (8080 in the example) and adjust the URL accordingly if you are using a different port or host.
